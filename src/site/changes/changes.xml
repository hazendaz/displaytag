    <release version="2.0" date="In SVN" description="">
      <action type="add" dev="rapruitt" issue="DISPL-451">Added a new PDF export that transforms the XML export with XSL-FO.
        Templates are customizable. Added support for TableTotaler, which is notified on subgroup starts and stops, and
        pulls the totaling logic out of the individual exporters or decorators. Added a special Excel export that writes
        2 versions of the export, subtotaled and not subtotaled, to 2 different sheets in the workbook. Refactoring to
        related classes to support these changes.
      </action>
      <action type="remove" dev="fgiust">Removed support for java 1.4/1.5 and removed the EL version of the tag library.
        Displaytag 2.0 will require at least java 1.6. For EL support you should just use a container that support
        direct evaluation of EL expressions (JSP 2.0) with the standard tag library, like tomcat 5.0 or above.
      </action>
      <action type="remove" dev="fgiust">The org.displaytag.decorator.ColumnDecorator interface, deprecated in displaytag
        1.1, has been removed.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="fgiust">Changed maven groupid from "displaytag" to "org.displaytag"</action>
      <action type="update" dev="fgiust">Updated code adding generics. Binary compatibility should be preserved, but you
        may need to adapt your code in order to compile with the new version.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="fgiust">Changed licensing from "artistic license" to a more standard, OSI-approved MIT
        license.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="fgiust" issue="DISPL-450 DISPL-650">Update itext to version 5.5.2. As a side effect, the RTF export
        format had tto be removed, since it's not supported anymore in recent itext versions.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="fgiust" due-to="Johno Crawford" issue="DISPL-688">CSV export fixes.</action>
      <action type="fix" dev="fgiust" due-to="Michael Osipov" issue="DISPL-687">
        I18nJstlAdapter should find a locale set in pageContext/request scope. Changed the
        &lt;tt&gt;org.displaytag.localization.LocaleResolver.resolveLocale(HttpServletRequest)&lt;/tt&gt;
        to
        &lt;tt&gt;org.displaytag.localization.LocaleResolver.resolveLocale(PageContext)&lt;/tt&gt;
        , so custom locale resolvers needs to be adapted in order to compile/work with displaytag 2.0.

      <action type="fix" dev="fgiust" issue="DISPL-292">
        Export in pdf/excel format was not exporting the full list with

        attribute to
        &lt;tt&gt;items&lt;/tt&gt;
        , since "name" was not appropriate anymore since setting the name of the object instead the direct reference was
        deprecated, now that support for the non EL-version has been dropped. Use
        &lt;tt&gt;items&lt;/tt&gt;
        to mimic standard jstl tags like
        &lt;tt&gt;c:forEach&lt;/tt&gt;
